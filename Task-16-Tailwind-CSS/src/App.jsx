            Fatherâ€™s Day celebrates and honors the men who have embraced the
            essential role of fatherhood. On this day, we also thank fathers and
            father figures (uncles, grandfathers) for the sacrifices they make,
            for embracing the responsibility of nurturing and raising children,
            and for their devotion to their families.
